  "about": "<p>After being tired of the stacks&nbsp;of mundane, generic store-brand greeting cards, we set out to pair our passion in cryptocurrency with designs&nbsp;inspired by the community. Each card features a pre-generated cryptocurrency wallet that can be transferred to the recipient. Like cash in an envelope, only better. The goal is to inspire new&nbsp;participants to join the financial revolution!</p><p>Crypto Greeting Cards are an affordable&nbsp;way to introduce friends, family, and loved ones to cryptocurrency. After redeeming the card, the recipient will learn:</p><ol><li>how to setup a wallet app</li><li>the difference between public address and private key</li><li>an introduction to transactions (sweeping funds)</li></ol><p>Is there any better way to spread cryptocurrency than kind words and a small gift?</p><p><br></p><h2>Security</h2><p>We take extensive precautions to ensure the security of the cryptocurrency wallet in each card. The printing and assembly is processed in-house. We do not store any copies of the&nbsp;private keys. <span>We recommend small value transfers ($20-100) intended for gift exchange. Please inform the recipient to sweep the balance at his/her earliest convenience. Do not use for long-term cold storage.</span></p><p>Our pre-generated cards are aimed to provide accessibility to individuals of all skill levels.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>For the true cypherpunk experience, consider generating your own keys with our DIY cards.</strong></p><h2><br></h2><h2>Instructions</h2><p><span>Visit:&nbsp;</span><span><a href=\"https://www.cryptogreetings.com/pages/instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.cryptogreetings.com/pages/instructions</a></span><br></p>",
